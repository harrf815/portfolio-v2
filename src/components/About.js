                         Hello. My name is Harrf Akbar and I am a software engineer. I am currently
                         looking to join a stable company that offers an opportunity for growth
                         while continuing to contribute my expertise and experience to benefit
                         mutual growth and success. I have 10+ years of managerial experience and I
                         excel at taking on new tasks and responsibilities needed. I strive to adapt
                         myself quickly into different environments and provide consistent results.
                         My goals when building an application are to be responsive, dynamic, and
                         efficient. I believe in a mindset of continuing education where I can
                         strengthen my knowledge on new material for any project or language. When I
                         am not working as a software engineer; I love spending time with my family
                         and friends as well as my hobbies. I try to stay active by playing various
                         sports such as football, basketball, and volleyball. I also enjoy camping
                         and traveling, however my ultimate enjoyment is laying on the beach. Thank
                         you for taking the time and learning more about myself and my work. I hope
                         for an opportunity to discuss my further goals and endeavors with you.

                         When breaking it down on what pushes me the hardest and what motivates me isâ€¦
                         myself. I know it may not be your typical answer, however, I know who I am
                         is not only a reflection of my work, but of the others around me. My
                         current mindset is to believe that I want to be better, I want to be the
                         best at what I do, and I want to continually grow. When I am striving and
                         doing my best, I know I can actively contribute to those around me and make
                         a positive impact in my community. I am aware where I currently stand with
                         my skills and know that this path and field has a long and difficult
                         journey ahead. Our field consists of many complex languages, frameworks,
                         and information that I can only hope to succeed in. I am not done learning,
                         and I will never stop learning. I understand the areas I need to
                         strengthen, and I know I can expand my knowledge to reach my highest
                         potential. I have come far from where I was a couple years ago, and I am
                         only just getting started.
